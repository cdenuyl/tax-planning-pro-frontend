# Tax-on-a-Me Incremental Refactoring Plan v2

## Strategy: Conservative Wrapper Approach

Instead of replacing existing modules entirely, we'll create wrapper functions that gradually introduce consolidated logic while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.

## Phase 1: Create Compatibility Layer

### Step 1: Enhanced Tax Constants (Conservative)
- Keep existing constants in place
- Add new consolidated constants alongside
- Create mapping functions for compatibility

### Step 2: Gradual Function Migration
- Start with utility functions that have no dependencies
- Add new consolidated functions alongside existing ones
- Gradually migrate callers one by one

### Step 3: Testing at Each Step
- Test after each small change
- Ensure no functionality breaks
- Maintain all existing interfaces

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Enhanced Constants File
```javascript
// src/utils/tax/enhancedConstants.js
// This will supplement existing constants without replacing them
```

### Step 2: Create Compatibility Wrapper
```javascript
// src/utils/tax/compatibilityWrapper.js
// This will provide the same interface as existing functions
// but use consolidated logic internally
```

### Step 3: Migrate One Function at a Time
- Start with `formatCurrency` and `formatPercentage`
- Then move to simple calculation functions
- Finally tackle complex calculation functions

### Step 4: Update Imports Gradually
- Update one component at a time
- Test thoroughly after each update
- Keep rollback capability

## Success Criteria
- Zero functionality changes
- Zero design changes
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved maintainability
- All tests pass
- Application works identically

## Rollback Plan
- Keep all original files as .backup
- Each step can be individually rolled back
- Full rollback possible at any time
