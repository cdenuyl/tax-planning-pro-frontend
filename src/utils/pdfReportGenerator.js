### Optimization Recommendations

<div class="recommendation-box">
<strong>Asset Location Optimization</strong>

1. **Tax-Inefficient Holdings** - Consider moving actively managed funds and bonds to tax-deferred accounts
2. **Tax-Efficient Holdings** - Place index funds and individual stocks in taxable accounts
3. **International Diversification** - Hold international funds in taxable accounts for foreign tax credit benefits
4. **Municipal Bonds** - Consider for high earners in taxable accounts
</div>

<div class="success-box">
<strong>Withdrawal Sequencing Strategy</strong>

Optimal withdrawal order for tax efficiency:
1. **First:** Taxable accounts (lowest tax impact)
2. **Second:** Tax-deferred accounts (manage bracket positioning)  
3. **Last:** Tax-free accounts (preserve tax-free growth)

### Claiming Strategy Analysis

Social Security benefits represent a significant component of retirement income for most Americans. Optimizing your claiming strategy can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional lifetime benefits.

### Current Social Security Position

<div class="recommendation-box">
<strong>Social Security Planning Considerations</strong>

- **Full Retirement Age (FRA)** - Your benefits are calculated based on your FRA
- **Early Claiming Penalties** - Claiming before FRA results in permanent benefit reductions
- **Delayed Retirement Credits** - Delaying benefits past FRA increases payments by 8% per year until age 70
- **Spousal Benefits** - Married couples have additional claiming strategies available
</div>

### Tax Implications of Social Security

Social Security benefits may be subject to federal income tax based on your "provisional income":

| Filing Status | Provisional Income | Tax on Benefits |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Single | $25,000 - $34,000 | Up to 50% taxable |
| Single | Over $34,000 | Up to 85% taxable |
| Married Filing Jointly | $32,000 - $44,000 | Up to 50% taxable |
| Married Filing Jointly | Over $44,000 | Up to 85% taxable |

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Claiming Age Optimization**
   - Analyze break-even points for different claiming ages
   - Consider health, longevity, and financial needs
   - Evaluate spousal claiming strategies

2. **Tax Planning Integration**
   - Manage other income sources to minimize Social Security taxation
   - Consider Roth conversions to reduce future provisional income
   - Time withdrawals from retirement accounts strategically

3. **Medicare Coordination**
   - Plan for Medicare premiums and IRMAA surcharges
   - Coordinate Social Security and Medicare enrollment timing

<strong>Recommended Analysis</strong>

A detailed Social Security optimization analysis should be performed to determine your optimal claiming strategy based on your specific circumstances, health considerations, and overall financial plan.

*Social Security optimization requires personalized analysis based on your earnings record, health status, and overall retirement plan. Consider consulting with a Social Security specialist for detailed claiming strategy analysis.*

### RMD Overview

Starting at age 73, you must begin taking Required Minimum Distributions from most tax-deferred retirement accounts. Proper RMD planning can minimize the tax impact and preserve more wealth for your beneficiaries.

### Your RMD-Subject Accounts

${rmdAccounts.length > 0 ? `
You have **${rmdAccounts.length}** accounts subject to RMD requirements with a total value of **${formatCurrency(totalRMDAssets)}**:

| Account | Type | Current Value | Estimated Annual RMD* |
|---------|------|---------------|----------------------|
${rmdAccounts.map(asset => {
  const estimatedRMD = (asset.currentValue || 0) * 0.04; // Rough 4% estimate
  return `| ${asset.name || asset.type} | ${asset.type.replace('-', ' ')} | ${formatCurrency(asset.currentValue || 0)} | ${formatCurrency(estimatedRMD)} |`;
}).join('\n')}

*Estimated based on 4% withdrawal rate. Actual RMDs vary by age and account balance.
` : `
No tax-deferred accounts identified that would be subject to RMD requirements. Consider whether additional tax-deferred savings opportunities align with your overall tax strategy.
`}

### RMD Planning Strategies

<div class="recommendation-box">
<strong>Pre-RMD Strategies (Before Age 73)</strong>

1. **Roth Conversions** - Convert traditional IRA/401(k) assets to Roth to reduce future RMDs
2. **Charitable Giving** - Consider donor-advised funds or charitable remainder trusts
3. **Asset Location** - Optimize investment placement across account types
4. **Withdrawal Timing** - Begin strategic withdrawals before RMDs are required
</div>

<div class="success-box">
<strong>During RMD Years (Age 73+)</strong>

1. **Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)** - Direct IRA distributions to charity (up to $100,000 annually)
2. **Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Sequencing** - Coordinate RMDs with other income sources
3. **Investment Management** - Position tax-inefficient investments in RMD accounts
4. **Estate Planning** - Consider stretch provisions for beneficiaries
</div>

### Tax Impact Analysis

${totalRMDAssets > 0 ? `
Based on your current RMD-subject assets of **${formatCurrency(totalRMDAssets)}**, estimated annual RMDs could be:

| Age | RMD Factor | Estimated RMD | Tax Impact (22% bracket) |
|-----|------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| 73 | 26.5 | ${formatCurrency(totalRMDAssets / 26.5)} | ${formatCurrency((totalRMDAssets / 26.5) * 0.22)} |
| 75 | 24.6 | ${formatCurrency(totalRMDAssets / 24.6)} | ${formatCurrency((totalRMDAssets / 24.6) * 0.22)} |
| 80 | 20.2 | ${formatCurrency(totalRMDAssets / 20.2)} | ${formatCurrency((totalRMDAssets / 20.2) * 0.22)} |
| 85 | 16.0 | ${formatCurrency(totalRMDAssets / 16.0)} | ${formatCurrency((totalRMDAssets / 16.0) * 0.22)} |

*Assumes current account values and 22% marginal tax rate. Actual results will vary based on account growth and tax law changes.*
